## Production Ideas (Unsolved Problems)

* A Real user of this product might want to add the option for visitors to register, get in touch, leave reviews, and all in all make this site a lot more interactive. It would be fun to create this additional database option and develop the site further to enable this update

* Another option would be to enable the option of said users "like" or "favorite" their favorite treats

* The cherry on the cupcake would be to enable purchasing options for this site. 

With an appropriate allotment of time and resources, anything is possible.

## Wireframing for this site was done mannually.
